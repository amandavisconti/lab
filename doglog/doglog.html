Ring™ Log is an experiment in speculative surveillance.

Amazon's Ring™ doorbells are motion-activated high definition surveillance cameras. Once triggered, Ring™ cameras transmit video to the Ring™ app and Ring™ servers, where the video footage is preserved for future viewing.

What happens when Amazon begins using AI object detection to identify, categorize, and report what the Ring™ camera sees?

Imagine a year from now, Halloween night, October 31, 2020. What would Ring™ see? What would Ring™ report? And what happens when the program fails, as programs always do?

(The scrambling text effect comes from Everest Pipkin's "If Jupiter had turned into a Star", published in Taper #2, under the same permissive copyright: http://taper.badquar.to/2/if_jupiter_had_turned_into_a_star.html)
