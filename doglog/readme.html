Mark Sample's <a href="https://www.fugitivetexts.net/ring/">Ring™️ Log</a> asks: "What happens when Amazon begins using AI object detection to identify, categorize, and report what the Ring™ camera sees?" (<a href="https://www.fugitivetexts.net/ring/about.html">Read more here!</a>) This page adapts that project to let the Ring™️ only see dogs, using data from Darius Kazemi's collaboratively built <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora">Corpora</a> repo.

"The scrambling text effect is adapted from Everest Pipkin's poem "If Jupiter had turned into a Star" (<a href="http://taper.badquar.to/2/if_jupiter_had_turned_into_a_star.html">external link<a/>), published in issue #2 of the digital poetry journal Taper (<a href="http://taper.badquar.to/2/index.html">external link</a>). Like all works published in Taper, the code of "If Jupiter had turned into a Star" is freely available to use and modify. Similarly the code for Ring™ Log is freely available to use and modify.
